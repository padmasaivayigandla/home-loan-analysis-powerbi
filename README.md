Home Loan Analysis using Power BI
=================================
Project Overview:
This project analyzes home loan data for a bank with approximately 25,000 customers using Power BI.  
The objective is to understand loan application trends, customer demographics, branch performance, and recovery patterns to support data-driven lending decisions.

Business Problem:
Banks face challenges in:
- Monitoring loan conversion across stages
- Identifying high-performing branches and channels
